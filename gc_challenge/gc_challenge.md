Create a website that contains a table with coloured cells and an input box with a submit button.
the table's cells can either be black or red. The first two cells are black and the next one is red
and this pattern continues creating an alternating sequence of 2 black and 1 red coloured cells.

Create a webpage using HTML and javascript where the user can input a new number using the textbox and submit
button and the number appears in a new cell on the table which is coloured as described above.
